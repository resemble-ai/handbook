# Benefits & Perks

We try to include benefits and perks that are useful for our employees. If you have a perk on your wishlist, feel free to let us know and we can evaluate it.

## Benefits

Employees based in Canada are eligible for our health and dental benefits. Saqib will enroll you into the plan once you join.

## Equipment

We provide any equipment that you need to be productive. At the start of employment, we ask each employee to pick a laptop of their choice.

## Remote Work

We're remote-first. We use Slack, Google Meet, Trello and other software to make this easier. We're still learning what it takes to make remote work even better. In general, we prioritize documentation and over-communicating to deal with the isolation that might occur with remote work.

## Conference Budget

We have a $1000/year conference budget for each employee.

## Foo Friday

At Resemble, we believe that the key to developing a world-class product and team is by fostering innovation and enabling continuous education. One way we encourage that is through the use of Foo Fridays. Foo Fridays is time for our employees to spend time on working on anything they want, Resemble-related or not. They can learn a new technology, prototype a new feature, work on a side project, develop a new skill, or even write blog posts. If it makes you better at what you do then go for it! Foo Fridays occur bi-weekly.

## Vacation

Resemble offers an unlimited vacation policy. We encourage everyone to take a minimum of 14 days off per year. This also means that we have offer unlimited sick days. To be respectful of this policy, please ensure that you notify your team and manager well in advance (if possible) to make sure that we can co-ordinate accordingly.
