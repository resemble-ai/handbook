# How We Work

## Cycles

A cycle is a 4-week period where projects that we’re prioritized Ideally, anything in this column should be fully completed within the 4-week period. This means that if we were to look at the kanban board at the end of 4 weeks, we should have very little in the Cycle and In Progress columns and a full Completed column. When we assign work, you are responsible to making tasks, and scoping the project as per the budget that we’ve assigned.

## Budget

The first thing you should do when you’ve been assigned a new project is set appropriate boundaries. Each project that starts off in cycle needs to be scoped so that we don’t end up down a rabbit hole. You are responsible for defining the initial scope of the task before it is discussed with the team. This will be your best bet at how the task should be approached, constraints of the problem, possible ideas and solutions, and an initial list of subtasks that are trackable in order to complete the larger task. At the end of a discussion, I will propose a time “budget” for when we need the task done by. You will be responsible for re-scoping the task such that it fits that budget and communicating any concerns that you have. The maximum budget for a task will be 4 weeks (i.e. the length of a cycle). The hope here is that we continuously keep shipping projects to the best quality possible - even if we have to limit the scope of what we’re doing. Every task that is on the kanban board needs to be budgeted before it enters the cycle.

## Ownership

Once we’ve decided on what we’re doing and how much time we’re allocating towards it, you have complete autonomy of how something should be executed. Ignoring all of the BS “engineering management” advice that is given - projects have the ability to change as you discover new things. That’s just the reality of how our world works. This means that on a day-to-day basis, the scope of the task can change. Through writing within the Notion card of the task, we can effectively keep everyone updated on the progress and raise any flags. Ownership also means that you are responsible for the entire completion of the task. There are no scrum-masters, ticket-managers, or integration engineers on this team. We trust that the people who are assigned to a task to taken on the entirety of it and work within the boundaries that were set during the budgeting phase.

## Projects vs Tasks

As you’ve probably noticed by now, we like to assign projects, not tasks. You’re not a code-monkey. A project is a collection of tasks that you define. Projects turn out a lot better when you have the responsibility to make the architectural decisions. We rely on you to spot the missing pieces and make necessary adjustments.

## Tracking Progress

As you get settled in with the project at hand, you’ll discover the many tasks that will need to be completed. Journaling in Notion serves as an excellent way of keeping yourself and everyone else informed. To-Do lists are a fantastic way of keeping yourself and others aware of progress. You should always aim to have something tangible to show or share as early and frequently as possible. This will not only make you happier, it will get more eyeballs on your work and hopefully start interesting discussions. This will also make stand-ups quicker as we would focus on the more pressing matters.

## Foo

Foo Fridays are meant for you to explore and do things you've always wanted to do. This can be related to work or  not. We just ask that you share your Foo days with us on Slack on the #foo channel.

## Cool Down Weeks

Working cycle to cycle without re-evaluating focus is a recipe for disaster. In order to get some time to reflect, experiment, and propose new ideas, we spend a week after each cycle to "cool down". At the end of the week, we collectively review the new cycle's goals and prioritize projects.

## Continuous Improvements

The processes that are laid out are not meant to get in your way of being productive. They’re not meant to be tedious, or repulsive. If at any time, you think something is stupid - it most likely is and it needs to be corrected.
