# How We Work

## Sprints

We work in short 1 week sprints that are tracked on Trello. Tasks are meant to be broken in the smallest tasks possible and tracked meticulously. On every monday, new items will be added to the sprint with a discussion from the entire team.

## Cycles

A "cycle" are 4 weeks long (4 sprints). Each cycle should correspond to a project.

The idea isn't that everything we decide to work on has to fit in one cycle. But we should ensure that each project is broken down into smaller projects so that we ensure that we're always making progress. 

## Communication

In short: It's better to over-communicate than to under-communicate.

We'll push you to share your thoughts and ideas and progress on a daily basis.

## Ownership

You will own entire projects or large tasks. Ownership does not make you a manager, and it does not put you higher than your co-workers. Rather, it gives you the responsibility to organize, collect thoughts, and ensure that the project is completed to a high-standard within the given time. 

## Foo

Foo Fridays are meant for you to explore and do things you've always wanted to do. This can be related to work or  not. We just ask that you share your Foo days with us on Slack on the #foo channel.

## Crazy Ideas

We love crazy. We'll occasionally push you to draw up crazy ideas that solve complex problems. These ideas should be tracked on Trello so we can remember them when we run into crazy problems.
