# Resemble AI Employee Handbook

As our company grows in size, its important to set guidelines for every new hire that joins the team. These guidelines are not meant to be technical, but they are to demonstrate our expectations, values, and core beliefs. This handbook will share what it means for us to be a company, how we got here, our culture, our processes, our thoughts on vacation time, on personal and professional growth, and eveything in between.

As we grow, you can expect this handbook to change. With every bit that I learn, I hope I can make this journey as enjoyable as possible while making sure that I'm creating an enviornment in where each of us can thrive and become better professionals and people.

Unlike other handbooks, we're going to try to keep this one as real and honest as possible - taking into account our diversity. If you're reading this as a new employee, it is your job to correct our old ways if anything is broken. Take advantage of having a fresh plate and tell us about what we're doing wrong and question us wherever possible.
