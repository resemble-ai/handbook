# Purpose:

We are fully committed to fostering a healthy and safe work environment for all. Our goal is to protect our employees from unwanted and inappropriate sexual behavior. We will take a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment and assault. These types of behaviors are prohibited inside and outside of the office. This policy will include a sexual harassment definition, examples of sexual harassment, details about complaint mechanisms, an overview of the investigation and disciplinary processes. Our culture is based on mutual respect and collaboration, and sexual harassment is a serious violation of those principles.
 
# Scope:

This policy applies to every person in our company regardless of gender, sexual orientation, function, seniority, status or other protected characteristics. We are all obliged to comply with this policy. This policy on inappropriate behavior is not limited to what occurs inside the office. Sexual harassment will not be tolerated at work, at off-site gatherings or anywhere else. Employees, investors, contractors, customers and everyone interacting with our company are covered by the present policy.

## Definition:

According to the Ontario Human Rights Code, sexual harassment is “engaging in a course of vexatious comment or conduct that is known or ought to be known to be unwelcome.” Below are some examples of what can be classified as sexual harassment:

- Asking for sex in exchange for a benefit or a favour.
- Using rude or insulting language or making comments toward women or men.
- Send or display sexually explicit objects or messages.
- Making unnecessary physical contact, including unwanted touching.
- Comment on someone’s looks, dress, sexuality or gender in a derogatory or objectifying manner or a manner that makes them uncomfortable.
- Posting or sharing pornography, sexual pictures or cartoons, sexually explicit graffiti, or other sexual images (including online).

The most extreme harassment is sexual assault and we will support and work with employees that want to press charges against offenders. 

## Our rules on sexual harassment:

No one has the right to sexually harass our employees. Any person in our company who is found guilty of serious harassment will be terminated. 

Sexual harassment is never too minor to be dealt with. Any kind of harassment can create a hostile workplace. All employees have a right to a workplace that is free of harassment. We will hear every claim and punish offenders appropriately.

Those who support or overlook sexual harassment are as much at fault as offenders. Anyone who witnesses an incident of sexual harassment or has other kinds of proof should report to HR. Letting this behavior go on or encouraging it will bring about disciplinary action. 

Sexual harassment is about how we make others feel. Many do not consider behaviors like flirting or sexual comments to be sexual harassment, thinking they are too innocent to be labeled that way. But, if something you do makes your colleagues uncomfortable, or makes them feel unsafe, you must stop.

We will not allow further victimization of harassed employees. We will fully support employees who were sexually harassed and will not take any adverse action against them.

## Filing a Complaint:

We acknowledge it’s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we need your help to build a fair and safe workplace for you and your colleagues. If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR. In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges.
 
## Complaint Procedure:

Once a complaint is made, or if we have reason to believe there is sexual harassment occurring, we immediately investigate and address the allegations.

- Collect as many details as possible
- Take immediate action (if the allegation warrants)
- Conduct interviews with witnesses, the harasser and other related parties
- Gather and document physical and digital evidence

If the investigation proves that the allegations are credible, we will immediately take appropriate corrective action. Depending on the severity of the sexual misconduct, corrective measures range from a single verbal warning to immediate dismissal and even criminal penalties.

## Disciplinary Action:

Harassers will be subject to progressive disciplinary action as follows:

- For infrequent or less serious allegations, the preparator may receive a verbal warning, or a written warning.
- For periodic or more serious sexual harassment incidents, the preparator may receive a demotion, a transfer, a suspension and perhaps criminal penalties such as a fine.
- For frequent or extremely serious allegations, the preparator will likely face termination and severe criminal penalties.

##  Confidentiality:

All inquiries, complaints and investigations are treated confidentially. Information is revealed strictly on a need-to-know basis. Information contained in a formal complaint is kept as confidential as possible. However, the identity of the complainant is usually revealed to the respondent and witnesses. HR takes adequate steps to ensure that the complainant is protected from retaliation during the period of the investigation. HR can answer any questions relating to the procedures for handling information related to sexual harassment complaints and investigations to complainants and respondents.

## Your Voice

Speaking up about sexual harassment is often tough for fear of not being heard, upsetting managers and challenging corporate culture. Resemble will do everything possible to stop sexual harassment and any other kind of harassment from happening. If you see something, say something. We need to know what’s going on so we can act on it. And by raising your voice on this issue, you help Resemble create a happy workplace and thrive.
