# What We Stand For

## Values

Our values are extremely important to us. It's what makes us difference from everyone us and they impact everything from our benefits, perks, all the way down to our product.

Key values:

* **EQ > IQ.** Resemble thrives when you and your co-workers thrive. This only happens when we work together and play on the same team. Being calm, and controlling emotions are expected of you at all times. Take a moment and consider what others are feeling, and communicate your thoughts calmly.

* **Do the right thing.** What is the right thing? Well this one requires your judgement. But the right approach would be to make sure that what you're doing is what you would be comfortable doing if the other person was you or your family. Saying "no" to others is sometimes the right answer, and if that's ever the case, you should feel comfortable saying it.

* **Continuous Feedback.** For professional and personal growth, we want to open as many channels as possible for feedback. Your code is tested on a daily basis - you should be tested frequently too. We make sure that we provide honest, real feedback that will help you become a better you. So expect praise but also critisism.

* **Ownership.** In the "You are Resemble" section, we said that you are responsible for things that you didn't work on directly. However, at Resemble, we're big on ownership and autonomy of tasks. You will be expected to take something from start to finish.

* **Creative + Innovative.** This is one of those things that will always evolve as we figure things out. Generally, we want to make sure that you're always expanding your skillset. Foo Friday's are great to tinker, learn, and become entrepreneurs. Resemble was once a side project, so we're keen on honing your creativity.
