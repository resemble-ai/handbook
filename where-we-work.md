# Where We Work

## Office

Resemble's HQ is based in Toronto, Canada in the Banting Institute near Queenâ€™s Park subway station.

## From home

Resemble is built to be a remote-first company. This means that we invest in tools and processes that help us all work remotely - even if we decide to go to the office. 

## From a coworking space

If working from home or a coffee shop doesn't suit you, working from a co-working space might fit the bill. Resemble offers a $200/month stipend towards a desk in such a place.
