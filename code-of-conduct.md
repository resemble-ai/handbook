Employees of Resemble are expected to act honestly, ethically, lawfully and in the best interests of the company while performing duties on behalf of Resemble. This code of conduct applies to all of our employees, including contractors and we expect all of our employees to follow it. Failure to abide by the code can result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment. If you have any questions or are unsure whether your conduct or the conduct of other Resemble employees complies with this code, please contact Zohaib or Saqib. 

# Equal Opportunity Employment:

We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities and we are dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone. This includes, but is not limited to members of any sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, social and economic class, educational level, color, immigration status, sex, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, mental and physical ability and any other characteristics protected by law. 

# Advisory Roles and Board Seats:

You should avoid accepting employment, advisory positions, or board seats with Resembles’ competitors or business partners if your judgement could appear to be influenced in a way that it could harm Resemble. If you’d like to accept a board seat with an outside company please notify Zohaib. And this goes without saying, do not start your own business if it will compete with Resemble.

# Professionalism:

You will be spending a majority of the time with the people you work with, whether it’s at Resemble or another company. With that in mind, you should always conduct yourself professionally. You are expected to treat everybody with the utmost respect. We have a zero tolerance policy for any exclusionary and harassment behaviour and there is no room for unlawful discrimination, bullying, and intimidation at Resemble. Difference of opinions are bound to happen in the workspace and, if anything we encourage that. But a disagreement with your colleague is no justification for any disrespectful behavior. If somebody asks you to stop doing or saying something because it’s making them uncomfortable, then stop. If you are being harassed, or notice that someone else is being harassed please contact Zohaib or Saqib.

# Privacy and Confidentiality:

It’s important not to disclose any confidential information of our customers. Our customers trust us by providing us with their personal information and audio data and we should be careful not to disclose any of it or discuss it with any outside parties.
