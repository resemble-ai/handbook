# Focus on building leaders

While working at Resemble, we want to make sure that you build your career in the path that you want. We want to make sure that the years you spend with us are rewarded and we help you work towards personal and professional goals. A large part of our philosophy is building leaders and utimately creating our legacy - which is you.

In the late 90s into the 2000s, GE produced the astounding leasers that eventually became CEOs Fortune 1000 companies. Similarly, Paypal created leaders that eventually started companies like Yelp, SpaceX, Tesla, LinkedIn, and Yammer.

My hope is that we create an environment that allows you to stay at Resemble for years, and then go on to create your own companies or create an impact whereever you go.

## Performance Feedback

Twice a year, Resemble employees receive formal feedback on their work performance. 

### 1:1s

Atleast once every two weeks, you will check in directly with your manager to discuss how work is going. This is not a technical check-in. This is time to improve our process and get feedback on how we're operating and fix what's broken. It's also a time where your manager will discuss performance and track goals that were set during the first week of your employment.
