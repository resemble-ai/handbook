# You are Resemble

While you're at Resemble, and when you decide to take on new challenges, we hope that the values that Resemble pushes forward are incorporated into your life.

Everyone that is working at Resemble represents Resemble. This means that all of us live beyond what we think our roles are. If a customer complains, it's on all of us. When a customer complains to Saqib, they're complaining to you. When someone sends a great tweet about us to the world, they're talking about you. 

It also means that when you talk internally to your co-workers at Resemble, make sure you treat them the way you would want to be treated if the roles were reversed. Respect, honesty, and being able to communicate things appropriately to other co-workers are one of our highest priorities as you will see repeatedly in this handbook.

Saying that, Resemble encourages everyone to speak up and share their thoughts and experiences. Difference of opinion at work is highly encouraged, but being open-minded is core to who we are. We're all here to learn - whether that comes from our customers or someone that joined yesterday - there is no difference.

We'd also like to mention that while we're a startup, thing's might get taxing. You may feel pressure to contribute. We make it a priority to hire people who are the best in what they do, so that means you were picked for a very good reason. However, we emphasize that Resemble is like a sports team - we will all have our down days. If you feel self-imposed burden to be exceptional all the time - stop. At the end of the day, this is a job. We hired you to do your best work, make your team better, and learn. Other than that, turn off your computer and do something that has nothing to do with us. Get a cat, they're really popular on the internet.
